# Chromatic starter

I recently came across chromatic and decided to take a tutorial on it. 
This project helped me understand why stories are important, how to create stories for components, how to test them properly, and how to deploy them.

The tutorial is a guided lesson from the Storybook docs which can be found [https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/intro-to-storybook/react/en/get-started/](here)

This tutorial uses `ReactJS` and `vanillaCSS`.
